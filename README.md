S. Weiss, S.J. Schlecht, and M. Moonen: "Best Least Squares Paraunitary 
Approximation of Matrices of Analytic Functions," submitted to IEEE 
Trans. Signal Process., Mar. 2025

The MATLAB code reproduces all figures and values from the paper for best reproducibility.

The code relies on the PEVD Toolbox, which can be found here: 
[http://pevd-toolbox.eee.strath.ac.uk/](http://pevd-toolbox.eee.strath.ac.uk/). The toolbox is also included as a submodule.
